Code Institute MileStone Project 1

Hidden Dome is a portal for music lovers to discover artists from the Nordic music industry. In the future it will feature more pages for reviews, podcasts, news, interviews and videos with advertising streams as a possibility. 

The initial site will consist of landing page with hero image, a gallery page for the Artists as an index, an About page and a Contact page. Within the site, there is a page for each artist with bio, links, reviews, a large image and a sample YouTube video embed. 

The colours and theme will be black and burnt orange gradient color scheme.
Nav Bar and links produce subtle fade effects on hover.
